  - HTTP attacks tracking (bad-user-agent, probing, CVE exploits)
  - Mail attacks tracking (HELO rejections, spam attempts)
  - Manual bans tracking (cscli, network bans)

  - ipset count monitoring (threat feed integration)
  - Blocked IP entries count (total protected IPs)
- Enhanced error handling for missing dependencies (jq, ipset)
- Improved JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Extended performance metrics collection

### Enhanced
- **Scenario Intelligence**: Detailed attack pattern analysis
- **Performance Monitoring**: ipset-based blocking efficiency
- **Threat Categorization**: HTTP vs Mail vs Manual interventions
- **Robustness**: Better handling of missing tools and empty datasets

### Technical Improvements
- Added `get_scenario_stats()` function for attack pattern analysis
- Added `get_ipset_stats()` function for performance monitoring  
- Enhanced JSON parsing with error handling

- Better performance data collection

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Total Services**: Up to 15+ services (Bouncers + Machines + Overview + Scenarios + Performance)
- **Attack Pattern Recognition**: Real-time scenario-based threat analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: ipset efficiency and blocking statistics
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From individual bouncer health to global threat landscape
